We panelise the board using aperture-scripting
First, export the gerber files using eagle and the CAM file from the fab, e.g. http://dirtypcbs.com/dirt_cheap_dirty_boards.v1.cam
Convert the .TXT drill file using gerbv to have a header with format specifications.
Then download aperture-scripting, (use patched version from https://github.com/StefanRvO/aperture-scripting if you can't get the standard version to work.
Install the dependencies (e.g. using vert, for issolated lua enviroment. use lua5.1)
run PowerSocket.cfg and RELAY_BOARD.cfg to generate the gerbers for the panalised boards.

#####
For aperture panalising to work, the boards must be excatly square, or you will get the error " in 'stroke' routing mode sides should have an odd number of segments"
